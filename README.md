# Graduates_Admission_Prediction_Using_ANN
This repository demonstrates a TensorFlow/Keras model for predicting graduate admission chances. It covers data loading, preprocessing (MinMax scaling), model creation, training, and evaluation. Furthermore, it includes visualizations of training/validation loss over epochs and computes the RÂ² score for predictions.
